                    <p>Murphy Yuezhen Niu is an Assistant Professor and Stansbury Chair in Computer Science at UCSB since 2024. Previously, she was a senior research scientist in the Google Quantum AI team, where her work focused on intelligent quantum control optimization and metrology, quantum machine learning, quantum algorithm design and near-term quantum error correction. Niu received her doctorate in theoretical and mathematical physics from MIT in 2018. She received the Claude E. Shannon Research Assistantship for her work at the intersection of photonic quantum computation, quantum error correction and quantum cryptography.

		    Professor Niu's long-term research goal is to develop quantum computing paradigms in regard to how we program, control, characterize, measure, and error correct a large-scale quantum computer without paying the steep price of digitization towards real-world impacts. Niu applies cutting-edge deep reinforcement learning and generative models to quantum control, quantum circuit compilation, and quantum system learning using some of the largest quantum computers based on superconducting qubits. Her recent research focus on developing scalable analog quantum control and algorithms for emerging quantum architectures with superconducting, ion trap, photonic, and neutral atom qubits.

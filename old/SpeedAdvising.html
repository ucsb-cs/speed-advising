	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font size="3">Come to the Computer Science Department&#39;s 
	Faculty-Undergraduate Advising event. This fun and informational event is 
	offered regularly for Computer Science Majors and students interested in 
	becoming Majors.</font></p>
	<p><font size="3">The next event will take place on </font></p>
	<p><font size="3"><b>Wednesday, Jan 25, 3:00pm - 6:00pm in the CS 
	conference room (1132 Harold Frank Hall)<br>
	</b><b><a href="FUAPW17.htm">These Faculty members and senior PhD students</a><a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~holl/fuap/FUAPW16.htm"></a> </b>are available during (part of) this time period. (<a href="FUAPW17.pdf">PDF version</a><a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~holl/fuap/fuap.pdf"></a>)&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p><font size="3">The semi-formal title of the event, &quot;Speed Advising,&quot; was 
	picked by the student members of the CS Undergraduate Affairs Committee to 
	indicate the flexible 'first-available matchup' format for the meetings between undergraduates and the CS 
	faculty.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p><font size="3">Students will come to the CS conference room (advising 
	headquarters) at any time in the above time interval, where they will get 
	some general information about the program and then be matched up with the 
	next available faculty member of their choosing for a 20 minute <br>
	advising chat. This hopefully provides some positive interactions and 
	&nbsp;information exchanges between students and faculty members, including a 
	better overview of the research going on in the department, as well as 
	pointers to opportunities, and also satisfies a degree requirement for CS 
	Majors (by getting informed about Major Electives).</font></p>
	<p><font size="3">Snacks and drinks will be available in the CS conference 
	room until we run out.</font></p>

<h2>General Tips</h2>
<ol><li>
<b>Ask the student about themselves</b> - ask if he/she had prior
programming experience
before college, to give a little summary about that experience, and to tell you
why he/she chose computer science as a major.
</li>
	<li>
<b>Try to assess the student&#39;s interests. </b>Ask questions like: What classes 
did you enjoy most so far. What was your favorite programming project / 
exercise. Steer him or her towards opportunities and faculty that may lie in 
their path of interest.&nbsp;
</li>
	<li>
<b>Get specifics on a student's peformance (grades) before giving opportunities</b> because students sometimes answer based on their confidence rather than
their objective performance.

<!--
Make sure you look at the student's transcript or ask specific information
on test / project scores (if too early for grades) to assess how the
student is doing rather than basing it on what the student says.

This is important because students who are very confident tend to overstate
their performance, and, perhaps more importantly, those who are not
very confident
tend to understate their performance.  In addition, females tend to play
down their strengths, and males tend to exaggerate their strengths.

First, statistics show that males are more likely to overstate their
performance,
while females are more likely to understate theirs.  This means that a male
advisor might be very willing to believe a female's poor assessment of herself,
thinking she is very "self aware and honest."  Quite the contrary.  She may be
either lacking in self confidence or displaying a female pattern of
communication.
Another set of statistics show that female self confidence is at the
lowest point
of their lives during their senior year in high school and freshman year in
college.  Males, on the other hand, bottom out in junior high and have recovered
by college.  This means that the females we see freshman year are likely to
be lacking in self confidence, so we should take extra care to encourage them.
This is played out in computer science by the fact that statistics
show that females
transfer out of the CS major "citing failure" with a
higher GPA than males do.  Thus, females are much more likely to tell an
advisor that they "don't get" computer science.
-->
</li><li>
<b>Be encouraging, especially for lower-division students</b>
<!--
The earlier it is in the student's career, the more encouraging, rather than
warning, the advisor should be.  For students who have no experience, they
might already feel like they don't belong.  It is detrimental for the advisor to
reinforce this in any way.  Instead, students should be told that their success
is dependent on hard work, going to office hours, knowing how to ask good
questions, etc.  Do not emphasize any concept of "natural talent" or
the need for previous experience, because even those who are talented may
think they're not and self select out.  Studies have shown that students who
are told that success is dependent on hard work, rather than talent, do much
better on exams.
-->
</li><li>
<b>Emphasize the role of practice, work over natural talent</b> because this
is both true and reduces stereotype threat, a phenomenon that causes 
underrepresented minorities to perform worse on exams.
</li>
	<li><b>Encourage the students to join clubs like ACM, WISH</b>, because it helps
people meet other students who have been in their situation.  In the
early classes, especially, several inexperienced students have
expressed intimidation about their skills compared to their peers'.
They found that joining CS clubs allowed them to meet people and see
that they were not in the minority - many students start without
experience and succeed. </li>
	<li>Encourage students to find a set of students in their course so they
can work at the same time in CSIL and commisserate?
</li>
	<li>Remind people about the <b>payoffs of computer science</b> - strong job
market, good salaries, lots of research opportunities, flexible
schedules (telecommuting).  Take the long view - you work hard for 4
years and the payoff is for the rest of your life.  Do you want to
work hard for 4 years or struggle for the rest of your life?  I know
what I want! :)
</li>
	<li><b>End on a positive note.</b>  Find something in which they've done well,
wish them luck in their next classes, say that you look forward to
seeing them at the next advising opportunity.

Also, you can suggest students talk to other upper-division students for

                    <p>Murphy Yuezhen Niu is an Assistant Professor and Stansbury Chair in Computer Science at UCSB since 2024. Previously, she was a senior research scientist in the Google Quantum AI team, where her work focused on intelligent quantum control optimization and metrology, quantum machine learning, quantum algorithm design and near-term quantum error correction. Niu received her doctorate in theoretical and mathematical physics from MIT in 2018. She received the Claude E. Shannon Research Assistantship for her work at the intersection of photonic quantum computation, quantum error correction and quantum cryptography.

		    Professor Niu's long-term research goal is to develop quantum computing paradigms in regard to how we program, control, characterize, measure, and error correct a large-scale quantum computer without paying the steep price of digitization towards real-world impacts. Niu applies cutting-edge deep reinforcement learning and generative models to quantum control, quantum circuit compilation, and quantum system learning using some of the largest quantum computers based on superconducting qubits. Her recent research focus on developing scalable analog quantum control and algorithms for emerging quantum architectures with superconducting, ion trap, photonic, and neutral atom qubits.

		    Banerjee is one of the world’s leading innovators in the field of nanoelectronics. His current research focuses on the physics, technology, and applications of two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene, for designing next-generation energy-efficient electronics, photonics, and bioelectronics. His pioneering contributions to nanoscale interconnect design and their energy-efficient solutions, particularly 3D integrated circuits, have been widely adopted and commercialized by the IC industry. His pathbreaking innovations with 2D van der Waals materials and heterostructures are setting the stage for next-generation electronics. This includes the invention of the Kinetic Inductor that overcame a 200-year old Faraday-limit of the inductance density of conventional materials.

		    Her research is focused on modeling, analysis, simulation and software, applied to multiscale, networked systems in biology, materials and social networks. Her research group has been developing advanced algorithms for discrete stochastic simulation of systems where the fate of a few key molecules can make a big difference to important outcomes.  We engage with experimentalists through the analysis of data and the development of mathematical models that yield insight and suggest new directions for research.  Current collaborations range from biology(circadian rhythm (jet lag), and cell polarization), to medicine (coagulopathy and post-traumatic stress disorder), to ecology (chytrid disease in frogs), to social networks  (sentiment analysis and opinion dynamics). Her group is collaborating with Prof. Chandra Krintz on the development of an integrated, cloud-based environment called Stochastic Simulation Service (StochSS) for modeling and simulation of biological processes

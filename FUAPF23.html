                        degree from
                        the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. His research is
                        in Computer Graphics.
                        During his Ph.D. career, Dr. Yan mainly aimed at rendering photo-realistic visual appearance at
                        real world complexity,
                        building theoretical foundations mathematically and physically to reveal the principles of the

                        He has brought original research topics to Computer Graphics, such as detailed rendering from
                        microstructure,
                        and real-time ray tracing with reconstruction. </p>

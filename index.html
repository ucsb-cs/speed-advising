			<font size="3">Come to the Computer Engineering and Computer Science Department&#39;s
				Faculty-Undergraduate Speed Advising event. This fun and informational event is
				offered regularly for CE and CS majors.</font>
		</p>

		<div style="border-color: coral;">
			<p>
				<font size="3"><b>October 25th, 2pm - 6pm at HFH 1132<br>
					<br>
				</b><b><a href="FUAPF23.html">These faculty members</a><a
						href="https://ucsb-cs.github.io/speed-advising/FUAPF23.html"></a> </b>are available during (part
					of) this time period. (<a href="FUAPF23.pdf">PDF version</a><a
							href="https://ucsb-cs.github.io/speed-advising/FUAPF23.pdf"></a>)&nbsp;</font>
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			<font size="3">The semi-formal title of the event, &quot;Speed Advising,&quot; was
				picked by the student members of the CS Undergraduate Affairs Committee to
				indicate the flexible 'first-available matchup' format for the meetings between undergraduates and the
				CE and CS
				faculty.&nbsp; </font>
		</p>
		<p>
			<font size="3">
				Drop in for a 20 minutes info session with faculty about:

				<ul>
					<li>Research opportunities within the CS department and CE program</li>
					<li>Internship & job advice</li>
					<li>Major Field Electives</li>
					<li>Graduate school advice</li>
					<li>General networking</li>
				</ul>

				<p>On Wednesday, begin by coming to Advising Central (1132 Harold Frank Hall) between 2pm and 6pm to
					sign up for a slot, have a slice of pizza, and hang out. There will be CS staff and students there
					to answer general questions and help you choose a faculty slot.</p>


				This hopefully provides some positive interactions and
				&nbsp;information exchanges between students and faculty members, including a
				better overview of the research going on in the department, as well as
				pointers to opportunities, and also satisfies a degree requirement for CS
				Majors (by getting informed about Major Electives).
			</font>
		</p>

		<p>
			<font size="3">
				We hope you will strongly consider attending and getting your questions answered in this low-pressure
				environment!

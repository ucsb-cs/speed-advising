	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font size="3">Come to the Computer Science Department&#39;s 
	Faculty-Undergraduate Advising event. This fun and informational event is 
	offered regularly for Computer Science majors.</font></p>

	<p><font size="3"><b>Wednesday, Oct 28, 3pm - 6pm on Zoom<br>
    <br>
	</b><b><a href="FUAPF20.htm">These faculty members</a><a href="https://ucsb-cs.github.io/speed-advising/FUAP20.html"></a> </b>are available during (part of) this time period. (<a href="FUAPF20_pdf.pdf">PDF version</a><a href="https://ucsb-cs.github.io/speed-advising/FUAPF20_pdf"></a>)&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p><font size="3">The semi-formal title of the event, &quot;Speed Advising,&quot; was 
	picked by the student members of the CS Undergraduate Affairs Committee to 
	indicate the flexible 'first-available matchup' format for the meetings between undergraduates and the CS 
	faculty.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p><font size="3">Students will log onto <a href="https://ucsb.zoom.us/j/89996539408?pwd=OVNDTWZIdVl4K2FVeHJNd1pRQU1iZz09">this Zoom link</a> at any time in the above time interval, where they will get 
	some general information about the program and then be matched up with the 
	next available faculty member of their choosing for a 20 minute 
	advising chat. This hopefully provides some positive interactions and 
	&nbsp;information exchanges between students and faculty members, including a 
	better overview of the research going on in the department, as well as 
	pointers to opportunities, and also satisfies a degree requirement for CS 
	Majors (by getting informed about Major Electives).</font></p>
	<p><font size="3">Although we won't be able to offer snacks and drinks to participants, we encourage faculty and students to bring their own cup of coffee or tea to enjoy during their conversations.</p>
